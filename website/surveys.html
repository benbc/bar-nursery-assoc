    <h2>Our surveys</h2>

<p>The Bar Nursery Association has conducted four internet
surveys.</p>

<p>The fourth survey, which can be completed by clicking <a
href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/5HDZB62">here</a>, seeks to
ascertain interest in the proposed Middle Temple nursery from
potential users.</p>

<p>The third survey, sought to find out whether support for a nursery
would affect the decisions of law students about pupillage and joining
a particular Inn.</p>

<p>The second survey, aimed to obtain a more detailed picture of the
likely demand for the proposed nursery, to assist in creating a
realistic business plan.</p>

<p>The first survey assessed support for the principle of nursery
facilities in or near the Inns of Court.  450 people responded,
and almost everyone was very enthusiastic about the idea.</p>
