    <h2>Our surveys</h2>

<p>The Bar Nursery Association has conducted three internet
surveys.</p>

<p>The first survey assessed support for the principle of nursery
facilities in or near the Inns of Court.  450 people responded,
and almost everyone was very enthusiastic about the idea.</p>

<p>The second survey, which can be completed by clicking <a
href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=8_2b8PEFZzHVk1W5pObKAOOw_3d_3d"
>here</a>, aims to obtain a more detailed picture of the likely demand
for the proposed nursery, to assist in creating a realistic business
plan.</p>

<p>The third survey, which can be completed by clicking <a
href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=2NuQKoydisezvcW5kws94w_3d_3d"
>here</a>, seeks to find out whether support for a nursery would
affect the decisions of law students about pupillage and joining a
particular Inn.</p>
