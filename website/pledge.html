    <h2>Make a Pledge</h2>

<p>The nursery will require initial investment to refurbish the site
and make it suitable and safe for children.  It will not be able to
compete with the commercial rent that Middle Temple could obtain were
the space to be used for offices.  The BNA is therefore proposing to
Middle Temple that if the lease is granted, the BNA will seek to raise
&pound;200,000 to support the initial costs of establishing the
nursery and compensate Middle Temple for the financial implications of
supporting the nursery instead of other potential uses for the
space.</p>

<p>If you support the Middle Temple proposal, please make a pledge to
help us reach our &pound;200,000 target.  We are seeking pledges from
individuals and chambers, which are conditional on Middle Temple
agreeing to lease the site to a nursery provider.</p>

<p>To make a pledge, please email the BNA (<a
href='mailto:admin@barnurseryassociation.org.uk'
>admin@barnurseryassociation.org.uk</a>) with your name, email address
and the amount of money you agree to pledge.  If the proposal is
successful, we envisage that the pledges will be converted to
donations which will be made to Middle Temple and will therefore be
charitable donations.</p>
