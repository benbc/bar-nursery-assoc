    <h2>About the Bar Nursery Association</h2>

<p>Women are leaving the independent Bar in disproportionate numbers
after having children. This is a matter of real concern, not only as
regards equal access to and diversity of the Bar, but also for the
achievement of those aims in the Judiciary.  Part of the solution
would be childcare provision within or near the Inns of Court.</p>

<p>The Bar Nursery Association is an unincorporated association
established in 2007 which aims to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Encourage the retention of women barristers at the Bar in the
  interests of equality and diversity</li>

  <li>Promote the establishment childcare facilities in or near the
  Inns of Court</li>

  <li>Improve the quality of life of barristers with young
  families</li>

</ul>

<p>The Patrons of the Bar Nursery Association are Baroness Hale, Lady
Justice Arden, Lord Walker, Sir Igor Judge, Mrs Justice Cox and Edwin
Glasgow QC.</p>

<p>The Bar Nursery Association is also supported by the Bar Council,
the Young Bar Committee and the Association of Women Barristers.</p>
