<h2>Proposed Middle Temple Nursery</h2>

<p>The BNA  is putting  a proposal  to Middle Temple  to use  the site
currently occupied  by the  St Clement's Cafe  to a  nursery provider.
The nursery would  be open from 7am to 7pm Monday  to Friday and would
provide high quality childcare for around 40 children aged 0 to 5.</p>

<p>The Middle Temple cafe site is the first location that has become
available in over two years that is suitable for the nursery.  The
site is more than suitable: it is ideal.  It has all the features
required for a successful Bar Nursery.</p>

<p>The Bar Nursery Association strongly believes that this is the best
opportunity to establish a nursery that is likely to arise in the
medium term, and that if the proposal is rejected by Middle Temple,
the prospects of there being a Bar Nursery in the next 10 years are
remote.</p>

<p>The proposed nursery would provide full time and part time places
as well as emergency care.  The BNA envisages that some chambers would
purchase hours of emergency care in advance for use by their members
and employees, and that individuals may also want to purchase advance
emergency care. It may be that priority will be offered to members and
employees of Middle Temple. Further details about the proposed nursery
can be obtained by contacting the BNA (<a
